# Web-Design-Challenge-UCB-Y5
Web-Design-Challenge for UC Berkeley Data Science Bootcamp


Considerations
You may use the weather data or choose another dataset. Alternatively, you may use the included cities dataset and pull the images from the assets folder.
You must use Bootstrap. This includes using the Bootstrap navbar component for the header on every page, the bootstrap table component for the data page, and the Bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page.
You must deploy your website to GitHub pages, with the website working on a live, publicly accessible URL as a result.
Be sure to use a CSS media query for the navigation menu.
Be sure your website works at all window widths/sizes.
Feel free to take some liberty in the visual aspects, but keep the core functionality the same.
Bonuses
Use a different dataset! The requirements above still hold, but make it your own.
Use a Bootstrap theme to customize your website. You may use a tool like Bootswatch. Make it look snazzy, give it some attitude. If using this, be sure you also meet all of the requirements listed above.
Add extra visualizations! The more comparisons the better, right?
Use meaningful glyphicons next to links in the header.
Have visualization navigation on every visualizations page with an active state. See the screenshots below.
